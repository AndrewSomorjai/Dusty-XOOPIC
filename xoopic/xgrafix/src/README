ALPHA Release of XGrafix Version 2.20 for Tk4.0/Tk4.1 with Fortran Port
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code for compiling XGrafix with the tk4.0 library (and
tcl7.4 or higher).  The tk4.0 release is not fully compatible with
previous releases and this required some revision of XGrafix.  This
library generated here is intended for use with tk4.0  (or higher).
It will NOT WORK if it is linked with previous versions of tk.

NOTES for Version 2.40 with Fortran Port
----------------------------------------

-The XGrafix library has been renamed to libXGC240.a.

-The Fortran interface library is named libXGF220.a. Use this library
 and the XGrafix C library libXGC220.a when compiling Fortran programs
 with XGrafix.

 Depending on your system, you may need additional Fortran libraries and
 Fortran compilation flags. This is because the implementation of the
 Fortran procedure "getarg" is system-dependent. For example, Suns need
 the library libF77.a while HP's need the flag +U77 and the library 
 libU77.a. For more information, do a "man getarg" on your system.
 We have tried to put the correct Fortran flags in the Imakefile.
 But Please edit the Imakefile (or Makefile.xgrafix) if the FFLAGS 
 parameter is incorrect for your system. Hopefully this will not be
 necessary.

-The default destination for the install is /usr/local/lib/xgrafix.

-Titles of diagnostic windows must be unique

-The PS print option has been replaced with an EPS print option.

NOTES for Version 2.50 with Fortran Port
----------------------------------------

- Library has been renamed to libXGC250.a

- Fortran interface library is now libXGF250; it now functions with 
libXGC250.a

- The Fortran version builds a C/C++ linkable libXGC250.a, so that 
both C and Fortran versions can be used simultaneously. This gives 
Fortran users capabilities such as EPS files and all other version 
2.50 capabilities availlable to C/C++ users.

- tcl/tk: more recent versions of tcl/tk than 7.5/4.1 should work properly when 
using the the TCL_TK_DEFINES = -DTcl75_Tk41 define in the Imakefile, including 
Tcl/Tk version 8.0.

NOTES for Version 2.70
----------------------
XGRead(...) and XGWrite(...) are found in xgio.h
