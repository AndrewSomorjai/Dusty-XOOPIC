This is a simple template which illustrates how
one can use xgrafix as a windowing environment for
viewing diagnostics in real time.  This template

Depending on your system architecture you may have to make
some modifications to the libraries and flags used when
compiling. The reason for this is that the implementation
of the Fortran procedure "getarg" depends on the system.
For more information, do a "man getarg" on your system.
For example, HP machines require the flag +U77 and the 
library libU77.a while Sun machines require  the
library libF77.a

For the titles of your graphs, avoid using periods and
square brackets [] since they conflict with tk functions.
