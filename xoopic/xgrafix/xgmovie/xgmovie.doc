xgmove

Description:  xgmovie is a program which takes recordings
from the Xgrafix 2.50 or later library and displays them.
Recordings are in the .bxg format. 
Presently, the following sorts of windows can be saved and replayed:

line plots
2d scatter plots
Vector plots
3d plots

Not supported:
3d irregular plots

The .bxg format saves frames into the file along with the
simulation time at which the frame is valid.  xgmovie 
has its own time and timestep though, and can skip frames:  xgmovie
will display the latest frame for each window which is at <= its
current time.

Usage:
xgmovie -i <inputfile>

Where inputfile has the following format:

timestep <max number of elements in a linear array to use>
filename1 x y
filename2 x2 y2
filename3 x3 y3
.....
END

Don't include the ".bxg" in the file name.

<max number of elements in a linear array to use>
is useful when you don't have a lot of memory, but your
.bxg file saved a LOT of points.  Suppose you
had 100k points in a .bxg file per frame, but you
wanted to show only every 10th one.  You'd choose
<max number of elements in a linear array> to be 10000.
